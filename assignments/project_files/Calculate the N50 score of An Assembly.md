<h2> Calculate the N50 score of An Assembly</h2>

N50 score is a measure of how complete a genome assembly is. It is calculated in a very simple way. First, all the contigs in the assembly are lined up in order of their sequence lengths. Then the contigs are counted, starting from the largest. Another way of thinking about it is that at least half of all the nucleotides in the assembly are in contigs with N50 length or longer.
