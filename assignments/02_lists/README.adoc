= My Favorite Things

Write a Python program called `favorite.py` that will accept one or more positional arguments that are one's favorite things.
The program should print the "things" joined by an optional `-s` or `--sep` (default `', '`).
If there is one "thing," it should print:

----
$ ./favorite.py cake
cake
This is one of my favorite things.
----

If there are two or more items:

----
$ ./favorite.py cake cookies
cake, cookies
These are a few of my favorite things.
----

If there is a `--sep`, use that:

----
$ ./favorite.py cake cookies -s '::'
cake::cookies
These are a few of my favorite things.
----

When run with no arguments, the program should print a brief usage:

----
$ ./favorite.py
usage: favorite.py [-h] [-s str] str [str ...]
favorite.py: error: the following arguments are required: str
----

When run with `-h` or `--help`, it should print a longer usage:

----
$ ./favorite.py -h
usage: favorite.py [-h] [-s str] str [str ...]

My Favorite Things

positional arguments:
  str                Some things

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -s str, --sep str  A separator (default: , )
----

It should pass all the tests:

----

pytest -xv test.py
